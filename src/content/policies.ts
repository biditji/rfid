/**
 * ⚠ POLICY TERMS — REVIEW BEFORE LAUNCH

 * The numbers and promises behind the Return & Refund and Shipping & Delivery
 * pages. Nothing in the codebase or the backend records these (the cart says
 * "Shipping: Calculated at checkout" but computes nothing), so each value below
 * is a conventional default for an Indian hardware seller, written so the pages
 * read correctly — not a decision the business has made.
 *
 * These are commitments to customers. Change any figure to match what the
 * business really does; the pages read from here, so one edit updates both.
