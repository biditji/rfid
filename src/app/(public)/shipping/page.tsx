      <PolicySection title="Order processing">
        <p>
          We begin processing an order once your payment is confirmed. Orders are normally packed and handed to the
          courier within {SHIPPING.processingTime}. Orders placed on Sundays and public holidays are processed on the
          next business day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an item is not in stock, or an order needs configuring before dispatch, we will contact you with a revised
          date before we ship.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Delivery areas and times">
        <p>
          We deliver to {SHIPPING.coverage}. The transit times in the table above start from the day the parcel is
          dispatched, not the day you order.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are estimates. Delays can be caused by courier handling, weather, strikes, local restrictions or
          incomplete addresses, and are outside our control. A delay does not entitle you to cancel an order that has
          already been dispatched, but please contact us if your parcel is more than a few days late and we will
          chase the courier for you.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Shipping charges">
        <p>
          Any shipping charge that applies to your order is confirmed before dispatch and is shown on your invoice. Prices on
          this website do not include shipping unless the product page says so, and GST is charged as applicable.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Tracking your order">
        <p>
          When your order is dispatched we send you the courier name and tracking number by email, SMS or WhatsApp.
          You can also check the status of your order on the{" "}

          <li>
            Please give a complete address with the PIN code and a phone number that will be answered, as the courier
            will call before delivery. We are not responsible for delays or non-delivery caused by an incorrect or
            incomplete address.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a parcel is returned to us because nobody could receive it, we will contact you to arrange another
            delivery. The cost of the second delivery may be charged to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please check the outer packaging when you receive the parcel. If it is damaged or has been opened, note it
            with the courier, and record a video of opening it.
